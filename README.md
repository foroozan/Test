Paymentsense coding challenge

1) Get Country Api is reading data from the data source(​https://restcountries.eu/​) and caching/retrieving data from MemoryCache. Swagger is used to show more details about the Api.
2) Angular UI is providing paginated Countries list and Countries details. 
To save time, I have used AngularMaterial which has inbox styles and functionalities to present the data.

Technologies used in Api includes:

.NetCore,
LazyCache,
Swagger,
Moq,
XUnit,
FluentAssertion

In UI packages includes:

AngularMaterial,
AppConfiguration
